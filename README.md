Hi, I’m Hiral
 
Project Name: Fate of a Martian impact crater
Manuscript description: Morella Crater on Mars reveals catastrophic floods from its breached crater lake. With a diameter of 76.97 km, it features Elaver Vallis on its eastern breach and the deep Ganges Cavus. Various geological processes like collapses, water pooling, breaching, and outflow channels unveil its intricate history. Thus, this study shed more, but convincing evidence on the origin and evolution of Morella Crater.

Technologies Used: The study utilized Mars Orbiter Laser Altimeter (MOLA) Digital Elevation Models (DEMs), High-Resolution Imaging Science Experiment (HiRISE) images, MRO Context Camera (CTX) images, Thermal Emission Imaging System (THEMIS), and Compact Reconnaissance Imaging Spectrometer of Mars (CRISM) data to analyse Morella crater's morphological features and processes. Software like ArcMap 10.8, HEC-RAS, Crater stats, and Envi were employed. Additionally, an illustrative model illustrating the crater's formation sequence was created using Interactive Erosion simulation in a Web Browser (Webgl-Erosion).
